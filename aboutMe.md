# Schooling

## High School
I had went to a technically highschool in Waterbury, CT. While attending the school I accoplished getting my hairdresser licenses at the age of 17.


## University 
I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at Quinnipiac University.

# What got me into Computer Science
What made me change my career field was the creativity and complex thinking that goes with this field. While watching my father do personal projects on the side line of his work, is what really drove me into going to school. Using modern technology and creativity to create anything you want.
